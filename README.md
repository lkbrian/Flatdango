# Flatdango Code Challenge

## Intro 
i have a four files and a folder inin my project one of each html
,css,js,json and a few images i have used in my project. 
html holds the makr up and style for the styling of my project 
the solution is provided in the Javascript file

## The solution
i defered my file on html first then started by declaring variables 
for my functions that is targeting the html DOM elements i need to 
manipulate the markup.then proceded to create 3 functions in my file
 the first of which i used to fetch data from the json file.
 
 next i build the movie names in my second function using a for loop 
  to iterate through the array of data i was able to fetch.

 after that i proceeded to build the default display  function  
 that is what appears when the page loads  and caled it inside 
 the first function,the one used to fetch data

 i then retracted to finish my second function and called it inside 
 the first function (that fetch's data) ,so as to display the data.
 I created it based on the basis of the loop to print out all the data 
 required and an event listener on the movie names to display the 
 required data ,i then proceeded to add an event listener to the button 
 so that it would be able compute available tickets and display sold 
 out when the computation results to 0.

 ## Conclusion 
 in conclusion this is what i used for my code challenge in terms solution:-
 - Functions
 - Fetch method to get data
 - Control flow statements
 - Event listeners
 - I did DOM manipulation on the markup

 Overall it was fun to be able to combile all of the above and be able
 to use them on my project.
